						<p>Throughout the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I have been challenged to learn new technologies and concepts. These challenges have helped me to shape my professional development, diversify my skillset, and build upon the foundation of knowledge I had already acquired. The coursework has helped me showcase the strengths I have and work on the gaps to make me a more well-rounded developer.</p>
						<p>In addition to this ePortfolio which realizes the culimination of my learning experience at Southern New Hampshire University. I have gained real experience with collaborating in a team environment and communicatinng with stakeholders by learning and practicing Agile principles. I had hands-on experience with complex data structures and algorithms using modern Python libraries like numpy and pandas, as well as, how to visisualize data using libraries like matplotlib and plotly. Additionally, I gained knowledge on TensorFlow & Keras to build scalable deep learning models. Southern New Hampshire gave us experience with software engineering and database principles, working inside of a modern MEAN full-stack for developing a working web application. Not only did we learn how to develop in these modern tools, we also learned security best practices. Learning how to use JWT-based authentication for protecting API endpoints and how to scan for vulnerabilities and patch them in our projects.</p>
						<p>This program has given holistic experience when it comes to modern software development. That experience is demonstrated through these three planned enhancements I've completed to this original artifact.</p>
						<p>The specific skills I aim to demonstrate through these enhancements are my ability to architect and deliver a production-ready application that could realistically be used by end users. I will demonstrate the following skills:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Clean and maintainable code that adheres to best practices and would not hamper future enhancements or team development efforts.</li>
							<li>Legacy environment modernization by migration to newer technologies or more appropriate languages/frameworks.</li>
							<li>Algorithmic proficiency by implementing data structures and algorithms improvements</li>
							<li>Database design, management, and integration by improvements made to already existing database application.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>These skill demonstrations are realized by the migration of a Java Android mobile application being migrated to a modern Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile application. With the design of having as much of the code in shared modules as possible. Making the deployments to other platforms such as web or desktop as efficient as possible. This migration resonates through the entire design from the usage of Jetpack Compose for UI rendering and SQLDelight for local database solution. The usage of alogrithmic solutions like linear regression, outlier detection using MAD-based Z-score, exponential smoothing for forecasting, and confidence scoring for goal estimation demonstrate my understanding of data structures and algorithms. Finally, my ability to create a dual database solution with SQLDelight locally and PostgreSQL on a server database solution exemplifies my proficiency in database design, management, and itnegration.</p>

						<p>The artifact selected for all three enhancements was a mobile application created in CS 360 last term. We were given an option to create one of three application concepts. I elected to create a weight tracking mobile application. This application was created using Java to run an Android mobile application. That would allow a user to sign in or register an account. Once they are logged in they would be able to set a weight goal and input weight entries on a daily basis to track their progress towards that goal. The application also supported the ability to send SMS messages to the user when they accomplished their goal based on the setting inside of the application and phone permissions.</p>
						<p>I selected this artifact because I found making mobile applications challenging, exciting, and rewarding. It’s something I’d actually like to do in my free time after I have graduated from SNHU. I also have been tracking my weight in a similar fashion inside of a Google Sheets spreadsheet and thought this would be a perfect opportunity to create something I could use. If I wanted to use this application I would need to write it for iOS and found Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile. So I wanted to learn Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile anyway. And with the enhancement requirements I thought it aligned perfectly to migrate it from Java (Android-only) to KMM and have support for Android and iOS.</p>

					<p>Enhancement One is a demonstration of skill in software design and engineering. In this enhancement, the original artifact, a Java Android Application project, was migrated to Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile with its existing functionality intact. While also being able to operate on both Android and iOS devices. In addition to this migration, technologies that best aligned with the philosophy and structure of shared modules was used. With Jetpack Compose being used to facilitate the creation of UI on both platforms with the same unified code. As well as, SQLDelight providing the same code and structure for both platforms on local database solution.</p>

					<p>Enhancement Two is a demonstration of skill in algorithms and data structure. In this enhancement, the same artifact from enhancement one was improved upon. In this enhancement, the artifact was improved by using algorithms like linear regression, outlier detection using MAD-based Z-score, exponential smoothing for forecasting, and confidence scoring for goal estimation. The mobile application was improved from a passive weight tracking application to an applicaiton able to analyze data and provide dynamic insights. In addition to formulas and new data structures being improved in this enhancement, there were a significant number of UI enhancements. These UI enhancements were made both visually available for the end user, as well as, the maintainability of the code.</p>

				<div class="row justify-content-center">
					<p>Enhancement Three is a demonstration of skill in databases. In this enhancement, the same artifact from enhancements one and two was improved upon. In this enhancement, the database solution was improved upon using ktor. Creating a server-sided solution paired with the client application and REST API endpoints to enable data transfer over network. The server sided PostgreSQL database was also configured to sync data to and from the local SQLDelight database on the client device. Additionally, authentication was improved from a client-sided transaction to being orchestrated by the server-side. With paswords no longer being stored on the device, but rather in the server and hashed using Argon2id. Authentication was used to create JWT-Based protection on protected routes. Finally, Exposed was used for type-safe DSL and lightweight ORM for accessing the PostgreSQL database.</p>
